Title: Extending Lasso Model Fitting to Big Data
Author: Yaohui Zeng [aut,cre], Chuyi Wang [aut,cre], Patrick Breheny [ctb]
Maintainer: Chuyi Wang <wwaa0208@gmail.com>
Description: Extend lasso and elastic-net model fitting for ultrahigh-dimensional, 
    multi-gigabyte data sets that cannot be loaded into memory. It's much more 
    memory- and computation-efficient as compared to existing lasso-fitting packages 
    like 'glmnet' and 'ncvreg', thus allowing for very powerful big data analysis 
    even with an ordinary laptop.
